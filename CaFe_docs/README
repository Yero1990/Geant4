In this directory are articles/slides relevant to
the study of proton interactions with CaFe targets
(Ca-48), in order to estimate the survival probability
of the proton once it exits the target.

This study is complementary to the Geant4 simulation
done on proton-Ca48 interactions to count how many
protons survive, and serves as a sanity check to the
Geant4 results.
