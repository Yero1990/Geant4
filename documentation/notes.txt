notes

* When building GEANT4, and you get the error:

CMake Error at cmake/Modules/G4CMakeMain.cmake:83 (message):
Geant4Py only supports 'global-dynamic' thread local storage


try to build with these flags:
-DGEANT4_USE_PYTHON=ON
-DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON
-DGEANT4_BUILD_TLS_MODEL=global-dynamic
